## **Project Title**

'Song Selector' is a simple program that uses user input to recommend songs.

## **Introduction**

This code was written as a part of the final project for the CFG Python beginner course.

This Kaggle dataset was used for selection based on several criteria: 
* mood (major/minor key)
* duration (ms)
* genre
* century (19-21)
<br>
A random result is then selected from the filtered sample and Spotipy (Spotify's API) is used to open and play the song in the browser version of the application.<br>
