Project Title
'Song Selector' is a simple program that uses user input to recommend songs.

Introduction
This code was written as a part of the final project for the CFG Python beginner course.

This Kaggle dataset was used for selection based on several criteria: mood (major/minor key), duration (ms), genre, and century (19-21). A random result is then selected from the filtered sample and Spotipy - Spotify's API - is used to open and play the song in the browser version of the application.

Libraries/packages used: 
pandas - for CSV parsing and filtering 
spotipy - for accessing Spotify's Web API 
requests - for sending an HTTP request 
python-dotenv - to set and access environmental variables
