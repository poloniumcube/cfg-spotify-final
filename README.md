## **Project Title**

'Song Selector' is a simple program that uses user input to recommend songs. 

## **Introduction**

This code was written as a part of the final project for the **[CFG]([https://github.com/username](https://codefirstgirls.com/))** Python beginner course.

[This Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thebumpkin/10400-classic-hits-10-genres-1923-to-2023) was used for selection based on several criteria: mood (major/minor key), duration (ms), genre, and century (19-21). A random result is then selected from the filtered sample and [Spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Spotify's API - is used to open and play the song in the browser version of the application.

Libraries/packages used:
  pandas - for CSV parsing and filtering
  spotipy - for accessing Spotify's Web API
  requests - for sending an HTTP request
  python-dotenv - to set and access environmental variables
